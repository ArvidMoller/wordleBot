# Description: This program sorts all words in words.txt file based on how common their letters are.
# Requried files: words.txt, sortedWords.txt
# Requried gems: void

# Gives all words in words.txt file points based on how common their letters are. sort() funciton is then called to sort the words so they can be enterd in the sortedWords.txt file.
#
# Paramiters: void
#
# Returns: void
